# Machine learning uses as below
# Self-driving cars
# Robotics
# Language Processing
# Vision Processing
# Forecasting stock market trends

# Machine learning in action
# Steps of ML
# 1. Import the data (mostly csv)
# 2. Clean the data
# 3. Split the Data into Training and Test Sets
# 4. Create a Model - selecting the algorithm of ML
# 5. Train the Model
# 6. Make Predictions
# 7. Evaluate and improve

# Libraries and Tools for ML
# Python Libraries for ML
# 1. Numpy - provide multidimensional array
# 2. Pands - data analysis library that provides data frame, the data frame is 2d data
# 3. MatPlotLib - 2d plotting library for creating graphics
# 4. Scikit-Learn - decision tree, Neural network, etc

# Environment: Jupyter - jupyter.org - to write code
# ANACONDA is used to install Jupyter
